This Python script uses the requests library to fetch web content and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML/XML content. It first obtains the sitemap XML from a website (https://www.pngmart.com/sitemap.xml) and then extracts all URLs containing 'posts' from it. The script then goes through the first site map URL and extracts a list of image URLs from it.

After obtaining the list of image URLs, it iterates through the URLs, retrieves the PNG images, and saves them locally using a unique filename. The try block is used to handle any exceptions that might occur during the process, ensuring the script continues to process other image URLs even if one fails. Comments have been added to explain each section of the code.

Example for usage: Training Machine Learning Image Recognition Models
